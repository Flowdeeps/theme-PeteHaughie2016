# Boilerplate v1.0
I find myself doing the same thing over and over and overâ€¦ so I decided to claim back some of my own time by building this as the first step to bootstrapping my way to my new personal site theme. It will also help me in my myriad other projects.

## Installation
Clone this repository as the basis of your new project.

Remove the .git folder and then git init as a new project. You're good to go.

$npm install

$bower install

$grunt build

$grunt watch

I use python's SimpleHTTPServer for most front-end 
projects which you can use by navigating to the folder 
holding your index and typing:

$python -m SimpleHTTPServer
